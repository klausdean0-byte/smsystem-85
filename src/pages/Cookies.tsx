            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Cookies are small text files that uniquely identify your browser or device. The cookie file is stored on your browser. 
              When you return to that website (or visit websites that use the same cookies) these websites recognize the cookies and your browsing device.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Cookies do many different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, 
              and generally improving your experience. Cookies can tell us, for example, whether you have visited our Services before.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Are there different types of cookies?</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              There are different types of cookies, including first party cookies (which are served directly by us to your computer or device) 
              and third party cookies (which are served by a third party on our behalf). Third party cookies enable third party features or 
              functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that 
              set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits 
              certain other websites.

              Cookies can remain on your device for different periods of time. Some cookies are session cookies, meaning that they exist only 
              while your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are permanent cookies, meaning 
              that they survive after your browser is closed. They can be used to recognise your computer when you open your browser and browse 
              the Internet again.
